#  Gloot react junior home assignment

This project contains a react web application and a minimal node.js REST-backend.

##  Prerequisites:
You need the following stuff installed on your computer to complete this assignment:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org)

##  Getting started
All commands should be run from this projects root directory.
1. Clone this project with git.
2. Open a terminal window and run `npm i && npm run server` to start the node.js backend server.
3. Open another terminal window and run `npm start` to start the react web application.
4. Visit `localhost:4444` in your browser.

The web application will update automatically when the source files changes.

##  Task

A promising young developer at g-loot started to write a game library application in react, but before he could finish the project, he suffered a flamingo bite to his pinky finger and may never code again. It's your job to complete the the application.

In the game library, the user should be able to:
* View a list of all games
* Delete an existing game from the list
* Add a new game to the list
* Edit an existing game in the list

The first two points are already done for your convenience. The form inputs for everything is already there, just add the functionality to it. All the server endpoints are described in `server.js`. Complete the functionality in `index.jsx` and `game-service.js`. Snoop the code for comments if you want to learn more!

And lastly, since the page currently looks like a potato, make it sexy using css!

You may solve this task in any way you wish, edit any file in the project, and install any new npm-packages should you feel the need to. If you want to add any extra functionality to show off, you may do so as well!
